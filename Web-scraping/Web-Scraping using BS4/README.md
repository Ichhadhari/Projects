 - [Using bs4 and selenium](https://github.com/vaibhav-rokde/PROJECTS/tree/main/Web-scraping/Web-Scraping%20using%20BS4/Using%20bs4%20and%20selenium) here I did webscrapping for bulk image dataset as per our requirements. This dataset can be further use for annotation of computer vision model. Main purpose behind that is save the time for collecting image dataset. As per my exception this work very fine. I have done some cleaning process and I get my bulk image dataset.
